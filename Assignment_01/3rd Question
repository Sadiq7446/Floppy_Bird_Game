# Create a class called AppleBasket whose constructor accepts two inputs: a string representing a color, and a number representing a quantity of apples. 
# The constructor should initialize two instance variables:apple_color and apple_quantity.
# Write a class method called increase that increases the quantity by 1 each time it is invoked. 
# You should also write a __str__ method for this class that returns a string of the format: "A basket of [quantity goes here] [color goes here] apples." 
# e.g. "A basket of 4 red apples." or "A basket of 50 blue apples."
